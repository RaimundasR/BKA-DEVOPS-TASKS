# **🚀 Multi-Node JS Docker + Caddy with HTTPS**

## **📌 Overview**
This setup includes:
- **Caddy reverse proxy**, serving multiple JS applications over **HTTPS**.
- **Host-level firewall restrictions**, allowing only port **443** for external access.

---

## **🛠️ Prerequisites**
- A **VM or host machine** with **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- A **domain name** with **DNS configured** to point to your server.
- **Caddy installed** (either directly on the machine or via Docker).

---

## **📄 Step 1: Configure `docker-compose.yml`**
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    container_name: caddy
    restart: always
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config

volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

---

## **📄 Step 2: Create `Caddyfile`**
This file configures Caddy to **serve JS applications over HTTPS**.

```caddyfile
1.domain.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}

2.domain.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3001
}
```

📌 **Ensure your DNS settings point `1.domain.com` and `2.domain.com` to your VM’s public IP.**  

---

## **🛠️ Step 3: Set Up Host Firewall Rules**
To restrict external access **except for HTTPS (443/tcp)**:

```bash
# Allow only SSH and HTTPS from external sources
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  # Allow HTTPS traffic
sudo ufw allow ssh       # Allow SSH access
sudo ufw enable
```

To check firewall status:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

## **🚀 Step 4: Build & Start Caddy**
Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

## **✅ Step 5: Verify Setup**
1. **Check running containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   caddy
   ```
2. **Test frontend services**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://1.domain.com
   curl -I https://2.domain.com
   ```
   Both should return **HTTP 200**.

3. **Check Caddy logs for any errors**:
   ```bash
   docker logs caddy --tail=50
   ```

## **🎯 Summary**
✅ **Caddy serves multiple JS applications over HTTPS**  
✅ **Firewall blocks all ports except 443/tcp**  

Your system is now **secure and accessible only via HTTPS**! 🚀🎉

**NOTE!!** your dns has been changed in cloudflare from  reversed proxy to only dns , because:

❌ What Happens in "Proxied" Mode?
- Cloudflare manages SSL termination.
- But Caddy still tries to issue certificates via Let's Encrypt.
- Let's Encrypt cannot validate the domain because Cloudflare hides the real IP.
- This breaks auto-renewal and might cause SSL failures.

Caddy, Nginx, or other servers will work with Cloudflare's "Proxied" Mode (which is the most secure) only when using Cloudflare-issued certificates. Internally issued Let's Encrypt SSL certificates from Caddy are suitable only for testing purposes.
